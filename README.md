## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

MIXXX DJ controller for Denon MC2000. 

MC 2000 was originally marketed as Serato DJ controller and included Serato Lite license. This mapping aims to emulate similar functionality for MIXXX open source DJ software. 

The controller is no longer produced and has not received a lot of attention recently: the user cerated MIXXX mappings for this controller are old and I couldn't get a lot of commands to work as expected on newer versions of MIXXX. (MIXXX does not produce an official mapping for Denon MC 2000)

This controller was developed near enough from scratch on MIXXX version 2.5 on a Windows platform. The JogWheel script was lifted from  https://github.com/gold-alex/Rotary-Encoder-Jogwheel-Mixxx: this seemed to offer better control. 

Extensive use is made of components.js framework with all mappings except jogWheel/JogTouch using this: this was done more for consistency than efficiency. This does mean mapping is JavaScript heavy.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
